I received funding for a three month visit to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) headquarters in Munich, Germany. I'll be here until May 31st!

While at ESO, I'll be working to make "mock" observations of simulated galaxies. This allows for more accurate comparisons between simulations and observations. Stay tuned for more details on my progress!
