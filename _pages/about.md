Hi, I'm Matthew Frosst, a third-year PhD student at the University of Western Australia, and International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research.

My day-to-day involves researching galaxy formation and evolution using high-resolution simulations from state-of-the-art high performance supercomputers. 

You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
